console-login-ascii-art
=======================

Displays old BBS login screens (and similar ANSI/ASCII art) on every linux console login

I just downloaded all the files from this directory: http://artscene.textfiles.com/ansi/bbs/
I removed a few that were too small or didn't seem to work on todays terminals.
Then I put them in the directory ~/.bash and added a fiew lines to .bashrc 
so that a random cool old BBS login will be displayed on every login.
