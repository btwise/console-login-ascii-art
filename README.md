Console-Login-ANSI-Art
=======================

Displays old BBS login screens (and similar ANSI/ASCII art) on every linux console login.

Installation
============
Copy the directory ".bash" to your homedir
```
cp .bash ~/ -r
```

and then add the commands to your ".bashrc" file to display a logo on every new bash terminal (do this only once):
```
cat .bashrc >> ~/.bashrc
```

Copyright notice
================
The ansi graphic files were NOT made by me. 
I downloaded all the ANSI files from this directory:

Thanks to Jason Scott for compiling that great list of long forgotten modem mailbox login screens.
In this repository I removed a few files that were too small or didn't seem to work on todays terminals.
